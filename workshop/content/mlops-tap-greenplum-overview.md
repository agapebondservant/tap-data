### VMware Greenplum

**VMware Greenplum** is a **_massively parallel processing (MPP)_**, **_open-source_** based, **_Big Data_** architecture 
for large scale analytics (up to petabyte-scale).

In this session, we will demonstrate how **Greenplum** integrates with **Tanzu Application Platform** 
for a reliable, end-to-end machine learning deployment cycle.
